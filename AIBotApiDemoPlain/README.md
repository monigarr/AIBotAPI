# AI Bot API Demo Plain
This is a simple example showing how to pull the AI Bot API endpoints with MashApe key into an Android project.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and 
testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
I used the following to build, test and compile this Android project on my phone:

* Android Studio 3 Canary Channel
* MashApe Developer Account (free) https://market.mashape.com
* AI Bot API Key (free) https://market.mashape.com/monigarr/ai-bots
* Gradle

### Installing
1. Download this project to your local dev computer or download the zip file (top right of Github page)
2. Open this project in Android Studio 3 
3. Clean and Rebuild project to verify it compiles on your local dev computer. You will see standard Android dev messages
if your dev computer is missing current standard libraries, gradle, etc. Android Studio asks you to install & update when
your dev computer needs to.
4. Open MainActivity.class in Android Studio
5. Review the TODO tab and follow the 4 Steps mentioned in the TODO tab.
6. Clean, Rebuild and Run on your own Android Phone.
7. First time you run this app on your Android Phone: you will see the Progress Bar at top
center of the phone screen showing it load the xml or json response from your endpoint.


## Deployment
Publish as you normally do for your industry standard Android apps in the Google Play Store.
